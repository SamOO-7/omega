"""Execute a command on remote server

SYNOPSIS:
    exec "<SHELL-COMMAND>"

DESCRIPTION:
    Most omega plugins intend to simulate shell commands
    to still be able to 'work' when command execution is blocked
    to PHP security restrictions.

    Therefore, a few remote servers still allow shell command
    execution. So despite a lower stealth, being able to run
    real shell commands is always useful to escalate privileges.

UNIX/Linux Additional Features:
    The PWD environment variable is kept up-to-date, by wrapping
    launched commands with a 'current path checker'.

    If you do `exec ./batch.sh`, the plugin wraps and runs:
    > cd $PWD; ./batch.sh; pwd

    So relative paths are correctly reached by commands, and
    PWD environment variable is updated according to remote $PWD.

WARNING:
    Considering omega's input parser, commands which
    contain quotes, semicolons, and other chars that could be
    interpreted by the framework MUST be quoted to be
    interpreted as a single argument.

    * Bad command:
    # Here, omega parser detects multiple commands:
    > exec echo 'foo bar' > /tmp/foobar; cat /etc/passwd

    * Good command:
    # Here, the whole string is correctly passed to plugin
    > exec "echo 'foo bar' > /tmp/foobar; cat /etc/passwd"

EXAMPLES:
    > exec ipconfig /all
      - Run the 'ipconfig' tool on windows servers
    > exec ls -la /etc
      - List any file in the /etc/ directory on *nix systems
    > exec "cat /etc/passwd | grep root; ls /tmp"
      - Just a multi command, which must be quoted because
        of the semicolon (see WARNING)
