# The Omega configuration file can be considered as a source
# file which is defaultly sourced at framework initialisation.
#
# It means that you just have to put the commands as you type them in
# the Omega shell interface in order to build your own configuration.
#
# NOTE: If any command fails, the Omega Framework will fail to
#       load this configuration file.


### Those aliases are enabled by default for retrocompatibility
### purposes. Those aliases can be removed without impacting the framework.


### Some configuration examples you may want to add:

## Change the PASSKEY to prevent others Omega users from using your payload
# set PASSKEY "YourPassKey"

## For vim addicts: don't change your habits !
# set EDITOR "vim"
# alias vim "edit"
