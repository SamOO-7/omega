# vi: ft=sh

# The Omega configuration file can be considered as a source
# file which is defaultly sourced at framework initialisation.
#
# It means that you just have to put the commands as you type them in
# the Omega shell interface in order to build your own configuration.
#
# NOTE: If any command fails, the omega framework will fail to
#       load this configuration file.


### Those aliases are enabled by default for retrocompatibility
### purposes. Those aliases can be removed without impacting the framework.
alias target    "set TARGET"
alias load      "session load"
alias save      "session save"
alias infect    "exploit"
alias lcd       "lrun cd"
alias lpwd      "lrun pwd"
alias clear     "lrun clear"
alias fileinfo  "stat"
alias backdoor  "exploit --get-backdoor"


### Some configuration examples you may want to add:

## Change the PASSKEY to prevent others omega users from using your backdoor
# set PASSKEY "YourPassKey"

## For vim addicts: don't change your habits !
# set EDITOR "vim"
# alias vim "edit"
